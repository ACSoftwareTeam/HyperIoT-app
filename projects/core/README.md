# Core

HyperIotCore library includes the client SDK for consuming hyperiot services and other utility services (e.g. logger).

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project core` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project core`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project core` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build core` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test core` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
