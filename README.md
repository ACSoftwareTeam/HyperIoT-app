# Hyperiot-app

HyperIoT Front End Angular Application is a project that includes all tools necessary to manage IoT and BigData projects through hyperiot platform and to access realtime and offline data through a dashboard.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.13.

Node v16 is required to run this project.

## Libraries Build

HyperIoT-app relies on `core`, `components` and `widets` libraries. Before running the application it is necessary to build the libraries with the command `ng build <library-name>`
> Note: Libraries should be build in the following order: core, components, widgets

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Internationalization

The project is designed to support multiple locales. Current available locales are english (default) and italian.
Use the `--configuration` option to start the application with a specified locale. (e.g. `ng serve --configuration it`).
Refer to the [Angular internationalization documentation](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-overview) to add new locales or for additional info.

## Proxy

Use the `--proxy-config` option to specify a proxy configuration file (e.g. `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json`)
Refer to the [Angular proxy documentation](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) for additional info.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
